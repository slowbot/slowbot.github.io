            <h2>creatureshop</h2>

            <p>It was a thrill to work with the historic Jim Henson Company to design and develop a responsive website for their special effects shop. For this project we built a nimble front end framework from scratch that would give us more control over layout and typography without the bloat of popular frameworks.</p>
